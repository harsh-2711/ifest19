                                get a chance like this? It doesn't matter whether you are a skilled coder or a newbie. Just give it a try, you may learn something new; who knows!<br><br> The event as explained is a team event. Team will be of 3 members
                                where each member will be given a chance to code for a specific amount of time and his next teammate will have to continue the work, just like it happens in relay races.

                                the opponent's robot immobilizes. An event that tests the creativity of your destructive minds, this war will require a combat-worthy use of your engineering skills. Prove your robot's invincibility by participating in
                                a battle of the bots.
                                <br><br> Participants will pit their robots against each other in an arena, and the fight will continue until one robot overtakes or overthrows another from the ring. There may be some surprise fun events and more surprising

                                    <li>Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.</li>
                                    <li>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.</li>
                                    <li>All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Problem statement : </strong>Design and construct a remote or wired controlled robot capable of fighting a one on one tournament.</p>
                                <p><strong>Dimensions and Fabrications : </strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The bot should fit in a box of dimension 1.7ft * 1.7ft * 1.7ft (l x b x h) with all mechanisms fully executing motions. Length and width is measured to the extremities of the Robot, i.e. includes any overhanging bodywork,
                                        weaponry or protrusions. The external device used to control the bot is not included in the size constraint.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Mobility : </strong>All bots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include :</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).</li>
                                    <li>Jumping and hopping is allowed to an extent of 1/2ft.</li>
                                    <li>Flying (using airfoil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Robot Control Requirements : </strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the bot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams
                                        are suggested to use only rated wires such as ISI marked. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If the bot is controlled wirelessly, the bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference
                                        with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.</li>
                                    <li>Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Battery and Power : </strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The machine can be powered electrically only. Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte types (such as Li-ion, NiCd, NiMH or dry cells).</li>
                                    <li>Working voltages must not exceed 24V DC (mean voltage) at any point of time.</li>
                                    <li>All power connections must be of an adequate grade and adequately insulated. Cables must be routed to minimize the chances of being cut.</li>
                                    <li>All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.</li>
                                    <li>Battery Eliminators are allowed and power source would be available at the venue for the eliminators. Motors: The robot should move as fast as possible around the arena with the help of motors.</li>
                                    <li>DC motors and stepper motors (12V-24V) can be used as per the design of bots.</li>
                                    <li>Helmets are a must. The person operating must wear proper protective gear at all times. Any inflammatory mechanisms that cause harm to the opposition intentionally will result in immediate disqualification.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Each round will be of 3 minutes and there will be 2 minutes break between rounds. Each match will consist of 3 rounds and best of 3 will be considered(other rules and regulations will be updated shortly). If a team
                                        feels that their bot has been damaged and/or has ran out of batteries when a round is in progress then that team can call for a pause. This will replace the 2 minute break that would have been given between rounds.
                                        This pause can only be called once per team per match. Each team is requested to bring at least 3 backup batteries to avoid any unnecessary delays in matches. We will not provide any backup batteries.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            Design a manually controlled or wireless robot that has the capacity to cover maximum distance in shortest time. But here’s the twist, the track isn’t going to be straightforward. The path may consist of unevenness, bridges, tunnel and a lot challenging
                            obstacles. Remember, just maximising the RPM will not help. You got to be a little smarter. And, get ready for an electrifying game at the end. So, you think your bot can be victorious? Then set in on track and have the glory!
