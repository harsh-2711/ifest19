                            Design a manually controlled or wireless robot that has the capacity to cover maximum distance in shortest time, facing the hurdles. The path may consist of unevenness, bridges, tunnel and a lot challenging obstacles. Remember, just maximising the RPM
                            will not help. You got to be a little smarter. And, get ready for an electrifying game at the end. So, you think your bot can be victorious? Then set in on track!

                                <li>10 seconds penalty will be added for robot leaving the track</li>
                                <li>If a bot cannot overcome some obstacles, the team can skip it with penalty added depending on the obstacle.</li>

                            and appreciate those students who have a distinct innovative skill as well as have a thorough knowledge of electronics.

                            Beware machines gonna kill "not you chill", machine gonna fight, machine gonna win, and rule the ring. May your machine be the king.
                            <br><br> Roboclash is a war between robots where the sole purpose is to win by immobilizing your opponent’s robot. Use all your engineering skills to design a robot which can defend it from opponents and more importantly destroy
                            your worthy opponent by immobilizing them. Cage of death is waiting for the destruction.
                            <br><br> Participants will pit their robots against each other in an arena and the fight will continue until one robot overtakes or overthrows another from the ring. Their may be some surprize fun events and more surprising
                            stuffs waiting for your bot in the cage. Where the condition will be of do or die. Be king or slave. So get excited and come up to show what you and your talent can do, in front of thousands of people cheering and warming the
                            breath.

                                <li>Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.</li>
                                <li>If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.</li>
                                <li>All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Problem statement : </strong>Design and construct a remote or wired controlled robot capable of fighting a one on one tournament.</p>
                            <p><strong>Dimensions and Fabrications : </strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The bot should fit in a box of dimension 1.7ft * 1.7ft * 1.7ft (l x b x h) with all mechanisms fully executing motions. Length and width is measured to the extremities of the Robot, i.e. includes any overhanging bodywork,
                                    weaponry or protrusions. The external device used to control the bot is not included in the size constraint.</li>

                                <li>If the bot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams
                                    are suggested to use only rated wires such as ISI marked. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.
                                </li>
                                <li>If the bot is controlled wirelessly, the bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference
                                    with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.</li>
                                <li>Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.</li>

                                <li>Working voltages must not exceed 24V DC (mean voltage) at any point of time.</li>
                                <li>All power connections must be of an adequate grade and adequately insulated. Cables must be routed to minimize the chances of being cut.</li>
                                <li>All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.</li>
                                <li>Battery Eliminators are allowed and power source would be available at the venue for the eliminators. Motors: The robot should move as fast as possible around the arena with the help of motors.</li>
                                <li>DC motors and stepper motors (12V-24V) can be used as per the design of bots.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Reach the venue 15 minutes prior to the start of the event. Latecomers would lose their time in the game.</li>
                                <li>For on spot registration reach the venue at least 30 minutes prior to the event.</li>
                                <li>There will be 15 questions and 45 minutes of playtime.</li>
                                <li>Each question has one answer, and the correct answer would lead you to the next question.</li>
                                <li>Answer should be written at the end of the URL as &lt;question_no.&gt;/&lt;your_answer&gt;. Answer is case insensitive and answer with more than one word should be jointly written.
                                    <br>Eg:- suppose your answer to question no. 3 is harry potter.<br>Then you should use https://iohunt.com/3/harrypotter to go to next question.
                                </li>
                                <li>If you are stuck in a particular question then you may use penalties and bypass that question but remember that no. of questions will increase by 1 for each penalties. That is you can at max attempt 15 questions correctly.
                                    <br>Eg:- using one penalties will increase total no. of questions to 16, using two penalties leads 17 questions like that..</li>
                                <li>You can use at most 3 penalties. Use the penalties wisely because at the end of the game penalties would be used to break tie.
                                </li>
                                <li>There would be three rankings first, second and third positions.</li>
                                <li>If a team completes the game in less than 45 minutes that team would straight away win and if it is a tie then team with less time is given priority. If time exceeds 45 minutes then the team attempting the maximum no. of
                                    questions would win the game. If two teams have attempted same no. of questions then the team which has used less no. of penalties would win.</li>
                                <li>Any team found discussing with other teams would be straight away disqualified.</li>
                                <li>You can use Google only on the pc allotted, any teams found googling on smartphones would be disqualified.</li>
